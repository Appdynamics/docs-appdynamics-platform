owner: Partners
This topic describes how to install and configure Appdynamics Platform Metrics in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
## <a id='overview-appd-nozzle'></a> Overview

AppDynamics Nozzle aggregates and forwards logs and metrics from the Loggregator Firehose to the AppDynamics Controller. The Controller process that data and provides the performance metrics of the underlying infrastructure of apps running on PCF. You can view them in the Metric Browser corresponding to the Nozzle application.

When you successfully configure AppDynamics Nozzle on PCF, a default application named appd-nozzle, is created on the AppDynamics Controller. Additionally, a default tier named appd-nozzle-tier and a default node named appd-nozzle-node are created under which corresponding metrics are recorded.

## <a id='before-you-start'></a> Before You Start

Do the following:

1. Create a [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) account if you do not have one.

1. [Set up the AppDynamics Controller](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Controller+Deployment).

1. Acquire at least one Go SDK Agent License.


## <a id='set-up-appd-nozzle'></a> Configuring AppDynamics Nozzle

1. Specify the following Nozzle configuration settings and click **Save**. All the fields are mandatory. You cannot add multiple Nozzle configurations.

  * **UAA token_endpoint URL**: The authentication token endpoint URL of the User Account and Authentication Service (UAA) API.
  * **Doppler Traffic Controller URL**: The doppler firehose endpoint.


    * Run the  cf command to `cf curl /v2/info`. The UAA token_endpoint and Doppler Traffic Controller URL are the values of `token_endpoint` and `doppler_logging_endpoint` respectively

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf curl /v2/info
{
...
"token_endpoint": "https://uaa.sys.pie-multi-az-blue.cfplatformeng.com",
...
"doppler_logging_endpoint": "wss://doppler.sys.pie-multi-az-blue.cfplatformeng.com:443",
}
</pre>



  * **Username**: Username for a member account belonging to **doppler.firehose** group. This is the authorized UAA user that AppDynamics Nozzle uses to access the Loggregator. For more information, see [How to Find Credentials](https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-firehose-nozzle#how-to-find-credentials).
  * **Password**: The password for the above account.


    <b><i>Do one of the following to get the credentials</i></b>
      * CF environments usually ship with **opentsdb-firehose-nozzle** account which already belongs to the doppler.firehose group. Use an existing account shipped with CloudFoundry, log in to the OPS Manager and select the PAS tile. Navigate to credentials > UAA > Opentsdb Nozzle Credentials. Copy the username and password.
      * (or) Create a new one in the doppler.firehose group with necessary permissions. For more information, see [UAA Client](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/firehose-nozzle#option-2-uaa-client).

  * **Controller Account Name**: The name of the account in the AppDynamics Controller. Access the account name in the AppDynamics Controller UI on the Account tab under License.
  * **Account Access Key**: The access key for the above Controller account. Access the account key in the AppDynamics Controller UI on the Account tab under License.
  * **Controller Host**: Hostname of the AppDynamics Controller.
  * **Controller Port**: The port on which the AppDynamics Controller listens for Nozzle traffic.
  * **Enable Controller SSL**: Establishes secures communication with the Controller.
  * **Username for Reporting Custom Dashboard**: Username of an account with custom dashboard creation permissions.
  * **Password**: Password for the above Account.

## <a id='configure-proxy-settings'></a> Configuring Proxy Settings for the AppDynamics Platform Monitoring Tile

If you're using a Proxy Server and SaaS controller, the two PCF apps deployed by the AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for PCF tile, AppDynamics Nozzle and the AppDynamics KPI Dashboard, require that you set environment variables to define the proxy host and port so the apps can communicate with the configured SaaS controller. 

You can configure the proxy environment variables in the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CF CLI) or using the Apps Manager user interface.

### Using Cloud Foundry CLI to Set Proxy Environment Variables

This section explains how to configure settings that use the Cloud Foundry CLI when interacting with the AppDynamics Nozzle and the AppDynamics KPI Dashboard, where `<version>` is the specific version of the tile deployed and substituted in the commands.

1. Open Terminal.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to configure the version that is associated with your org appdynamics-org and space appdynamics-space.
 
        $ cf target -o appdynamics-org -s appdynamics-space
        $ cf apps
        (filtered)
        appdnozzle-<version>
        appdpcfdashboard-<version>

1. Navigate to the **AppDynamics Nozzle** app and set the specific version of the tile deployed:  
 
        $ cf set-env appdnozzle-<version> APPD_SDK_CONTROLLER_HTTP_PROXY_HOST host
        $ cf set-env appdnozzle-<version> APPD_SDK_CONTROLLER_HTTP_PROXY_PORT port
        $ cf set-env appdnozzle-<version> APPD_SDK_CONTROLLER_HTTP_PROXY_USERNAME user
        $ cf set-env appdnozzle-<version> APPD_SDK_CONTROLLER_HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD password
 
1. Navigate to the **AppDynamics KPI Dashboard** app and set the specific version of the tile deployed:
 
        $ cf set-env appdpcfdashboard-<version> HTTP_PROXY http://user@password:host:port
        $ cf set-env appdpcfdashboard-<version> HTTPS_PROXY https://user@password:host:https_port
 
1. Restage the apps for the environment variables to take effect:

        $ cf restage appdnozzle-<version>
        $ cf restage  appdpcfdashboard-<version>

### Using Apps Manager to Set Proxy Environment Variables

The proxy environment variables set for the AppDynamics Nozzle and the AppDynamics KPI Dashboard using the Cloud Foundry CLI can also be configured using the **Apps Manager**.

### AppDynamics Nozzle app
1. Open the AppD **Apps Manager** and navigate to the appdynamics space.
1. In the **appdnozzle`-<version>`** app, open the **Settings** tab. 
1. Click **REVEAL USER PROVIDED ENV VARS**.

    ![](./images/reveal-user-envars.png)

1. Add the proxy environment variables and click **SAVE**.

    ![](./images/add-envars-save.png)

1. Click the **Restart** button to restart the app.

    ![](./images/restart-app-ui.png)

### AppDynamics KPI Dashboard app 
1. Open the AppD Apps Manager and navigate to the **appdynamics space**.
1. In the **appdpcfdashboard`-<version>`** app, open the **Settings** tab. 
1. Click **REVEAL USER PROVIDED ENV VARS**.

    ![](./images/pcf-dashboard-user-envars.png)

1. Add the proxy environment variables and click **SAVE**.

1. Click the **Restart** button to restart the app.

## <a id='overide-nozzle-ops-manager'></a> Advanced Configuration of AppDynamics Application

This configuration is optional for 4.5.x Controllers. The Application, Tier, Node name on the Controller are created as `appd-nozzle`, `appd-nozzle-tier`, and `appd-nozzle-node` respectively on the fly.
This can be overriden by setting the below configuration. Note that the Application and Tier need not be precreated here. Just enter the names you want the metrics under.

However, for the 4.4.x Controllers, this setting is mandatory. You have to pre-create the Application and Tier on the AppDynamics Controller and enter the configuration. Note that the Tier must be `Go SDK` tier.


1. In the **Advanced Configuration (Optional for 4.5.x Controllers)** tab, specify the following settings and click **Save**.
   ![](./images/nozzle-adv-config.png)
    * **Nozzle Application Name**: Enter a name to identify the Nozzle application on the Controller.
    * **Nozzle Tier Name**: Enter the tier name for the Nozzle application you defined previously. This MUST be Go SDK Tier
    * **Nozzle Tier ID**: Enter the component ID you identified previously.
    * **Nozzle Node Name**: Enter a name for the node that corresponds to the Application Name, such as **_app-name_-node**.

1. In the Installation Dashboard, click **Apply Changes** and wait for all the changes to be applied.
