## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a multi-cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). It provides
continuous delivery and supports the full app development lifecycle, from initial
development through all testing stages to deployment. PCFâ€™s container-based architecture
runs apps in any programming language over a variety of cloud service providers.

[AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/appdynamics-platform/)
provides visibility into the PCF platform where your AppDynamics-monitored applications are deployed.
The tile deploys a Firehose Nozzle that collects various KPI metrics and publishes them to a Controller.
It also deploys a Dashboard App that automatically creates KPI health rules and custom dashboards
associated with the health rules.
