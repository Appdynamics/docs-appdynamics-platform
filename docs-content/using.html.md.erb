## <a id='overide-nozzle-cf'></a>Overriding Default Nozzle Configuration


The Nozzle is shipped to work with the basic configuration you enter by using the tile forms.
However, most of the configuration entries can be overridden.
If the CF command line tool is installed in your environment,
you can override the default Nozzle configuration by setting the environment variables and restaging the application:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf set-env appdnozzle ENVNAME ENVVALUE
$ cf restage appdnozzle-{version}
</pre>

The table below summarizes the environment variables, their default and allowed values, and the description.
